    {
      question: 'What is the primary purpose of the useState hook in React?',
      choices: ['To define state in functional components', 'To update the state in class components', 'To connect components to the Redux store', 'To handle asynchronous operations'],
      correctAnswer: 'To define state in functional components',
    },
    {
      question: 'In React, what happens when you modify the state directly without using the setState method?',
      choices: ['It throws an error', 'It updates the state as expected', 'It triggers a re-render, but the state remains unchanged', 'It results in unpredictable behavior'],
      correctAnswer: 'It results in unpredictable behavior',

    {
      question: 'How do you initialize state in a functional component using the useState hook?',
      choices: ['const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)', 'state = useState(initialState)', 'useState(initialState)', 'setInitialState(initialState)'],
      correctAnswer: 'const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)',

    {
      question: 'What is the key difference between props and state in React?',
      choices: ['Props are mutable, while state is immutable', 'Props are used for communication between parent and child components, while state is used for internal component data', 'Props are only accessible in functional components, while state is only accessible in class components', 'State is passed down from parent to child components, while props are managed internally within a component'],
      correctAnswer: 'Props are used for communication between parent and child components, while state is used for internal component data',
    },
    {
      question: 'How can you update the state based on the previous state using the setState method?',
      choices: ['By passing a callback function to setState', 'By directly modifying the state object', 'By using the prevState parameter in setState', 'By using the previousState parameter in setState'],

    },
    {
      question: 'What is the purpose of the defaultProps property in a React component?',
      choices: ['To set default values for props', 'To define default state values', 'To set default styles for the component', 'To specify default lifecycle methods'],
      correctAnswer: 'To set default values for props',
